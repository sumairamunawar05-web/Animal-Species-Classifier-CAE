# Animal-Species-Classifier-CAE
A Machine learning project that classifies wildlife species (cat/dog/wild) using a two-stage approach:  1. Convolutional Autoencoder for unsupervised feature learning 2. Dense Neural Network for classification
An end-to-end Machine learning project for wildlife species classification built from scratch using Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). This project supports **SDG 15: Life on Land** through automated biodiversity monitoring and species identification.
