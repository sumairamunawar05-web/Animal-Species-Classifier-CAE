Project Overview
This project focuses on animal species classification using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) on the AFHQ-512 dataset. The objective is to classify images into three categories—cat, dog, and wild animals—by leveraging unsupervised feature learning followed by supervised classification.
Instead of directly training a deep CNN classifier, this work explores how unsupervised representation learning can extract meaningful latent features that improve generalization and reduce overfitting, especially when class labels are limited.

Motivation
Traditional CNN classifiers rely entirely on labeled data and may overfit when trained on visually diverse datasets such as wildlife images. To address this challenge, a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is used to:
Learn compact and informative latent representations
Reduce dependence on labels during feature extraction
Improve classification performance through pretraining
This approach aligns well with real-world wildlife and veterinary applications, where labeled data is often scarce but raw images are abundant.
